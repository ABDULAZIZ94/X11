We are pleased to announce a new release of the Haskell binding for
X11 which provides a binding to most of Xlib. The library is
distributed as open source.

The library can be downloaded from: http://www.haskell.org/packages/.
You will need GreenCard 3.00 and GHC 6.0 to build the library.
Installation instructions are in x11/Install.
Bug reports should be sent to X11@reid-consulting-uk.ltd.uk

Enjoy!
