To build this package using Cabal directly from darcs, you must run
"autoreconf" before the usual Cabal build steps (configure/build/install).
autoreconf is included in the GNU autoconf tools.  There is no need to run
the "configure" script: the "setup configure" step will do this for you.

If you are building from a source tarball, you can just use the standard cabal
installation stanza:

    runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=$HOME
    runhaskell Setup.hs build
    runhaskell Setup.hs install --user

Xinerama support is enabled by default if Xinerama headers are detected.  To
disable Xinerama support, add the '--without-xinerama' flag to configure:

    runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=$HOME --without-xinerama

However, if you are building from darcs, X11 uses autoconf, so you need
to have autoconf installed and run autoconf/autoheader before building:

    autoconf
    autoheader

or 

    autoreconf
